## Documentation

### Milestone-1

The first sprint consists of creating a basic account creation and login system with proper authentication [Fig-1.1]. The login system shall require a valid and signed up email address with relevant password to pass the authentication. The sign up section required user data to make a successful account creation. A basic UI to display the Kanban board is also designed partially [Fig-1.2].

### Milestone-2

This sprint concentrates on providing functionalities for the created UI design to allow the user to create separate workflows. Customizing the list headers, rearranging the workflows between the lists and Displaying information in workflows is also aimed to be completed in this sprint.

### Milestone-3

The final sprint concentrates on desiging an UI for making changes to the information in each workflow by double-clicking over the workflow.

Limited Filter options are also implemented for management ease.
